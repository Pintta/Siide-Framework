Siide Framework v1.0 semi hc version

This is a semi hc level role playing server framework. This is working, but there may be more bugs and more. This is being developed and has already been developed for about a year. Development of this Framework has begun in January 2021 and is continuing.

When creating a character, you can choose for yourself: Male / Female / Binary.

Nor does this framework work with other scripts, as this is a truly peculiar entity. This is developed entirely as student work by a college student
